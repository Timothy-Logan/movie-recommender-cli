### "No recommendations found"
- Some criteria might not return results for certain movies
- Try a different recommendation method
- Use option 7 to see all available recommendations

### API Key Issues
- Make sure you're using the v3 API key (not v4)
- Check that you copied the entire key without extra spaces
- Verify your API key is active in your TMDB account settings

### Connection Errors
